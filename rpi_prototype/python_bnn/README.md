# BNN
## Python Training Framework
To run memory profiler on keras code obtained from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04270.pdf, keras 2.2.4 and tensorflow 1.8 is required. Memory profiler (memory_profiler 0.58.0) used to profile the memory usage of keras code.

For the Training Framework in this repo, the Python package used is:
1. Python - 3.7.7
2. NumPy - 1.18.5
3. Tensorflow - 2.3.0
4. memory_profiler - 0.58.0

Test codes for Python BNN Training Framework is located in `core/test`.
